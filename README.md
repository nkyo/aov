### players

A player can have different values in different contexts. The general classification within the game concepts itself splits the players into two teams: red and blue. On a technical level, however, when using peer-to-peer connections, I split the players into a host and client classification. The best way to look at it is the game classification \[red/blue\] will be managed by data passed between components and technical classification \[host/client\] will be written into separate components.
